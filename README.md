# How to use this Project:

## Package:  org.example

The entry point for this project is located in the package ‘org.example’ in the file Program.Java which contains the implementation for the Program class containing the main entry point method.

This method has invocations for the 10 separate examples of the various design patterns discussed in this module.  Each of the invocations is currently commented out, and contains an invoker for the appropriate example.  To activate an example, simple uncomment the line of code in main invoking the appropriate invoker for the chosen example.

## Package:  org.example.aaa.invocation

The 10 individual invokers are classes located in this package.  Each invoker contains the effective entry point to that example.  Each invoker class exposes a public static void run() method to serve as an entry point.  The code you will find in this class is similar to what you might find in a standalone example containing its own static void main.
